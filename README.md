# 50-days-code-challenge
Dear Lions and Lionesses

As a part of the Mother's day and Father's day initiative and the drive to make VIT Bhopal, the happiest place to be - we are launching the #DrGViswanathan challenges in partnership with FACE prep, our training partner.

We’re thrilled to announce the launch of our 50 Days Coding Challenge, starting today!

This initiative is designed to help you stay consistent, improve your problem-solving skills, and prepare effectively for both product and service-based company placements.

🔹 What’s the challenge? Every day for the next 50 days, you’ll receive two coding questions: One from Data Structures and another is from Programming Fundamentals

⏰ You’ll have 24 hours to solve the problems. 📹 The next day, we’ll share video solutions to the previous day's questions along with the next set of problems.

Let’s stay committed and make these 50 days a powerful step forward in your coding journey. Whether you're brushing up on basics or sharpening advanced skills — this challenge is for you.

Let’s get started and make every day count! 💪
